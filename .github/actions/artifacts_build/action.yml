    # Per https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/docker-pull-ecr-image.html, it is possible to
    # make unauthorized calls to get public ECR images (needed to build the ADOT Node docker image), but
    # it can fail if you previously authenticated to a public repo. Adding this step to log out, so we
    # ensure we can make unauthenticated call. This is important for making the pr_build workflow run on
    # PRs created from forked repos.
